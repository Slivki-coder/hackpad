# Hackpad
This is a macropad created in Fusion 360/kiCAD which has 4 buttons. The idea is to attack it to your monitor using double sided tape to get a macro bar below yor monitor. It has some basic macros, Undo, Copy, Paste and clear console

## Overall Design
3D modeling in Fusion 360, the PCB was imported as a 3d model from KiCAD. The microcontroller is on the other side of the pcb so it is not visible
